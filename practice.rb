# Cryptocurrency is all the rage. You have decided to create your own,
# KelloggCoin, that will massively disrupt financial markets at the Global
# Hub.

# Don't change the following code, which represents a series of transactions, each
# of which represents a transfer of KelloggCoin from one user to another â€“ transactions 
# with no from_user are from the "ICO" (Initial Coin Offering)

# Write code below that returns the number of KelloggCoin that each user has in their 
# KelloggCoin "wallet".

# It should print out:
# Ben's KelloggCoin balance is 14000
# Brian's KelloggCoin balance is 13000
# Evan's KelloggCoin balance is 10350
# Anthony's KelloggCoin balance is 2650

# ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ Your code HERE ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

# Calculate balances

# blockchain.each will iterated over each element in the blockchain array (square brackets)

  # Subtract amount from sender's balance if applicable

  # balances[from_user] accesses the current blance associated with from_user in the balances hash
  # if there's not existing balance for from_user, Ruby initializes it to 0
  # if from_user is not nil, if it is nil the line is skipped
  balances[from_user] = balances[from_user] -  amount  if from_user

  # Add amount to receiver's balance

  #balances[to_user] accesses the current balance associated with the "to_user" in the balances hash
  # if there's no existing balance, it's set to 0
